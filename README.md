Arduino code for various sensors, devices, and applications

The home automation, autopilot flight stabilizer, and joystick controller are meant to be customizable.  

Most of these applications run on the Nano, but some are for the Mega and for the Yun.  

Some of the GPS applications do not work and have been abandoned.

Let me know if you need hardware schematics for anything.
